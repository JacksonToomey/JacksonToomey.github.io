I removed the color from the header to keep things simple.  It looks cleaner and clearer.  I notice that I tend to try to add more and more to styling, which I need to resist.  "Less is more" is a cliche but a true one.  I think this is the right approach until I add more functionality, trying to add too much would be overkill, since the site doesn't even have pagination yet.
