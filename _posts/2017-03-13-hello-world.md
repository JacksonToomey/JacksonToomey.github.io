I'm scared of UI.  I know it sounds odd, but as a developer I find myself far more comfortable in the bits of back-end code than designing interfaces and interactions.  This is particularly frustrating since I love great UI.  I have to admit there have been times I have foregone desired functionality for an app that has a significantly better UI experience.

So with this blog I'm conquering my fear.  No bootstrap, just my own CSS.  Each entry will be me slowly making changes, adding features and trying to learn UI.
