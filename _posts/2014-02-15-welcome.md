Hi, I'm Jackson and this is my github blog.  I'll be using this blog to document my many adventures in coding and various other technical projects, including this site itself.  This site is built using jekyll, which can be found at [their website](http://jekyllrb.com/).  Jekyll is a site generator as opposed to a full framework and so far it's been relatively straightforward to use, and things like pagination are pretty easy. Jekyll basically reads from the folder structure to generate a static site and uses markdown so that adding posts is a simple, streamlined process.  The only downside is that doing things like comments and users would be relatively difficult, however that will probably be outside the scope of this site for the time being.

Some projects I will be working on will include:

- eLogger: a boring log program for soil borings.
- Vyndr: a website for discussing and tracking vinyl albums.
- Splitsville: a simple bill splitting app.
- My github.io site: The site you're reading now.

So check back often, I should be updating regularly.

-Jackson
